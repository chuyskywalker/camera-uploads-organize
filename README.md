Got a "Camera Uploads" folder? Organize it into sane folders!

Dropbox allows for simple uploading of photos, video, etc from a phone is great feature. However, a single folder with _thousands_ of files in it, not so great. Use this application to organize all the files into folders for year and month.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/chuyskywalker/camera-uploads-organize/releases), drop it in the "Camera Uploads" folder, and run the application. Ta da, organized into `yyyy/mm/img` directory structure.
